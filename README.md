## 🚀 Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **UI Components**: Custom components using shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Hooks and Context
- **Routing**: React Router
- **API Communication**: TanStack Query
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom animations and glassmorphism effects
- **Bundler**: Vite

## 🔧 Project Structure

The application follows a modular architecture:

```
src/
├── components/         # Reusable UI components
├── lib/                # Utility functions and data models
├── pages/              # Page components (routes)
├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks
├── services/           # API services
└── db/                 # Mock database and data access
```

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Natural Language Processing**: When a user enters a grocery list in natural language, the application parses the input to identify products and quantities. It matches items against the product database using fuzzy matching and semantic understanding.

2. **Product Recommendation**: The system analyzes the user's cart contents and shopping history to suggest relevant products. Recommendations consider factors like complementary items, frequently bought together products, and seasonal offerings.

3. **Interactive UI**: The interface features smooth animations, responsive design, and accessibility considerations to ensure a seamless user experience across all devices.
